### Hi there 👋

Currently I am attending **HyperionDev** bootcamp to develop coding skills, mainly focused on _Web Development_. So far I have gained knowledge in ***HTML, CSS, JavaScript*** coding. I'm also learning about functions and functional programming. The course is not halfway done yet, so there is still a lot of things to learn about!

In the future, I will be looking for a career in Web Development, and I am already excited about my career change! 💻 At the moment I work in a coffee shop, so I'd say I excel at making coffee! ☕️
